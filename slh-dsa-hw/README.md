# slh-dsa (ESP32-S3 hardware-accelerated fork)

This is a local fork of RustCrypto's [`slh-dsa`] crate, modified to add an ESP32-S3 hardware
SHA-256/SHA-512 acceleration backend (the `hw-sha` Cargo feature) for use by this repository's
`nano-signer` firmware. It is **not** RustCrypto's own crate, is not published to crates.io under
this name, and is not affiliated with or endorsed by the RustCrypto project. See
`../NANO_DOCUMENTATION.md` for exactly what was changed, why, and how it was verified.

Original crate: <https://github.com/RustCrypto/signatures/tree/master/slh-dsa>
(pure Rust implementation of SLH-DSA, aka SPHINCS+, per the [FIPS-205 Standard]).

## What changed from upstream

- `src/hashes/hw.rs` (new file): hardware SHA-256/SHA-512 backend for the ESP32-S3 SHA peripheral.
- `src/hashes/sha2.rs`: added hardware-backed variants of `Sha2L1` and `Sha2L35`, feature-gated
  behind `hw-sha`, alongside the original (unmodified) software implementations.
- `src/hashes.rs`: wires in the `hw` module and re-exports `init_hw_sha`/`hw_sha256`.
- `Cargo.toml`: added the `hw-sha` feature and its optional `esp-hal`/`critical-section`/`nb`
  dependencies.

Everything else in `src/` is unmodified from upstream `slh-dsa 0.2.0-rc.5`.

`Cargo.toml`'s `[package] name` is deliberately kept as `"slh-dsa"` (not renamed) so `nano-signer`,
which depends on this via `path = "../slh-dsa-hw"`, needs no import changes to use it.

## Design notes

The source comments in `src/hashes/hw.rs` and `src/hashes/sha2.rs` are kept short and point back
here for the reasoning; this section is where that reasoning actually lives. `../NANO_DOCUMENTATION.md`
has the full narrative (including the mistakes made along the way); this is the condensed version.

**Scope.** Both `Sha2L1` (128s/128f) and `Sha2L35` (192s/192f/256s/256f) are fully hardware-backed
under `hw-sha`, including `prf_msg`/`h_msg`. Those two were initially left on software, on the
assumption that running once per signature made their cost negligible; that was wrong; their cost
scales with the signed message's length, not their call count, and became the dominant cost once
everything else got faster. `prf_msg` is HMAC, and esp-hal has no hardware HMAC wrapper, so it's a
hand-rolled `H((K^opad) || H((K^ipad) || message))` construction around the hardware SHA-256/512
primitive. This is only correct because every HMAC key here (`sk_prf`) is at most 32 bytes, always
shorter than either hash's block size; the "hash an over-long key down first" case in the full HMAC
spec is not implemented, since it never applies.

**The SHA peripheral is a singleton**, so it lives in one global `critical_section`-guarded static
(`hw.rs`) rather than being threaded through `HashSuite`'s `&self` methods. [`init_hw_sha`] must be
called once at boot with the driver from `esp_hal::init()`'s `Peripherals`; every hardware-backed
method panics with a clear message if that never happened, rather than silently doing something
else.

**Prefixes are re-hashed per call, not cached as peripheral state.** Every `f`/`h`/`t`/`prf_sk` call
starts with the same `pk_seed`-derived block; the software suite caches that as a `Sha256`/`Sha512`
midstate and `.clone()`s it per call. An earlier revision of this fork tried the hardware
equivalent, `esp_hal::sha::Context`'s save/restore support, and it doesn't work: `Context<A>`
derives `Clone`/`Debug`, which adds an `A: Clone`/`A: Debug` bound on the generic parameter itself
regardless of whether the type actually needs it, and esp-hal's `Sha256`/`Sha512` marker types
never implement either. `Context<Sha256>: Clone` is unsatisfiable for any real algorithm. This was
only caught by a real build against the actual target; the API looks correct from reading the
source alone. The prefix is now stored as plain bytes and re-hashed from scratch on every call via
a fresh `ShaDigest`, giving up that one optimization while keeping everything else on hardware.

**Digests are always taken at full length and truncated in Rust**, never via the peripheral's
"short hash" option (requesting fewer bytes than the full digest). There was no way to verify in
this environment that a hardware short digest is bit-identical to a full digest truncated by hand;
getting that wrong would silently produce wrong signatures, so this doesn't rely on it.

**A lifetime gotcha in `hw_hmac_sha256`/`hw_hmac_sha512`:** don't build the HMAC inner hash by
chaining a function-local buffer (`ipad`) onto the `parts` parameter with `.chain()`. `parts`'s
type carries the function's own generic lifetime, which the *caller* controls and could be
`'static`; `.chain()` needs both sides to share one concrete `Item` type, which would require the
borrow checker to prove a local stack array outlives an arbitrary external lifetime, which it can't.
Feed the local buffer and `parts` to the hasher as two separate steps instead (see how
`HwPrefix256::hash` already does this for its own cached-prefix-plus-parts case).

## ⚠️ Security Warning

The upstream implementation has never been independently audited. The hardware-acceleration
changes in this fork have not been audited either, and have received considerably less scrutiny
than upstream's own code. **Use at your own risk**, more so than you would with unmodified
RustCrypto crates.
